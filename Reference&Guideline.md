# Reference & Guideline of this project

## point1
1. Add data to the backend
- As I was window user, it was lot hard to install ruby first. installed ruby 3.3.1 
version with rbenv, which is manager of ruby. And installed related bundle with command 'bundle install'
. And to run the ruby application, marked ruby interpreter and ENV (development). 
- To add the contacts to the database(sqlite3), edited add_contacts.sh file. 
- In add_contacts.sh, there are three empty arrays (fullnames=(),emails=(),shortnames=()) that will store parsed data in 
data.txt file. And before doing all of these procedure, it checks whether the database is empty, so if it is not empty,
it just exits itself.
